    <title>Let the journey begin . . .</title>
    <body>
        <p>Welcome to my journey – As a strog believer of the sentiment “all who wander are not lost” (my apologies to Tolkien as the correct quote is “Not all those who wander are lost” but I’ve never been one to color inside the lines. I’m setting out on a new path, seeking new adventures</p>
    <h1>Starting point</h1>
        <p>Before we enter unchartered territory let me let a little about myself. After spending over 13 years as a School Librarian I decided to embark on a different career path and found work as a Paralegal for a group of high-level attorneys. Looking back as that career decision the question arises whether I am a glutton for punishment. Fast forward to March of 2020 when my position as a paralegal was eliminated. Well as the saying goes when one door closes another opens and I learned about the opportunity to learn how to be a Full Stack Developer which answers the previous question – that yes, clearly I am a glutton for punishment and will even seek it out apparently. </p>
  <h1>These are some of the essentials that I am bringing along with me on this new journey</h1>
<ul>
    <li>People skills – clearly anyone who can work with both small children and lawyers has people skills</li>
    <li>Database skills as I converted an entire library catalog to online environment </li>
    <li>Proficiency searching the internet</li>
    <li>Purchasing experience</li>
    <li>Customer Service</li>
</ul>
<h1>A quick aside - some of my absolute favorite children’s books</h1>
